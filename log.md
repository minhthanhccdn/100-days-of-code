**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio Project, finised header of the page

Another practice on sticky header as previous projects,... So I think I have to preview it for sure!

### Day 3: Aug 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
- Continue working on FCC Personal Portfolio Project
- Try tweaking CSS to adapt it to reponsive view
- Learn things by viewing other people's code that I don't know how to implement that, and try to apply a bit by bit to the the project
- Realize that reponsive design is a huge subject.
**Thoughts**: Reponsive design is pretty tricky and hard, I cound spend more time on it.
Should finish this project tommorow
